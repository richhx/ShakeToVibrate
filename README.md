# What is this for?

I have always been interested in mobile programming and ever since I got my own
Android smartphone, I have always wanted to make my own application and so I 
decided why not? In this repository, I am building an application that really 
does not do much. It has a bunch of random features that I hope to implement
into a later application/idea.
