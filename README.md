# What is this for?

I have always been interested in mobile programming and ever since I got my own
Android smartphone, I have always wanted to make my own application and so I 
decided why not? In this repository, I am building an application that really 
does not do much. It has a bunch of random features that I hope to implement
into a later application/idea. Some of these features include the use of
android permissions, vibration, camera usage, data writing and saving, settings 
fragments, layout in activities, action bars, and graphics. This is practice
for me before I start developing real applications.
